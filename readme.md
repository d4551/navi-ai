## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.19.0 (or Node 22.12+) — 20 LTS recommended
- npm 10+
- For native modules on Windows (better-sqlite3, keytar):
  - Python 3 (added to PATH)
  - Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ Desktop workload)

### Quick Start (Desktop/Electron)

- Clone and install: `npm install`
- Dev mode (starts Vite + Electron): `npm run electron-dev`
- Production preview (local build): `npm run build && npm run electron`
- Package installers (Win/Mac/Linux): `npm run electron-build`

### Quick Start (Web Only)

- Dev server: `npm run dev` then open the shown URL
- Preview a production build: `npm run build && npm run preview`

### Notes (Usage)

- To use a custom dev port for Electron: `VITE_PORT=5180 npm run electron-dev:port`
- App settings persist locally; API keys are stored on your device and never committed.
- First run may take a minute while dependencies build native modules.

### Troubleshooting

- If Electron can't find the dev server, ensure Vite is running on the same port or use `electron-dev` which starts both.
- Clear caches on odd rebuild issues: `npm run clean` (or `clean:all` to remove `node_modules`).
- Windows PowerShell users may prefer `electron-dev` over `electron-dev:port` due to shell env syntax differences.
- Rebuild native modules for Electron if launch fails: `npm run rebuild:native`

#### macOS: electron-builder permission denied (code 126)

If you see `sh: node_modules/.bin/electron-builder: Permission denied` during install:

```bash
# Remove quarantine flags and add exec bits to local binaries
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine node_modules/.bin || true
find node_modules/.bin -type f ! -name "*.cmd" ! -name "*.ps1" -exec chmod +x {} +

# Re-run just the native deps step (optional)
npx electron-builder install-app-deps
```

You can also skip the postinstall step entirely and run it later:

```bash
NAVI_SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1 npm install
npx electron-builder install-app-deps
```

#### EBADENGINE warnings for Redocly

Some dev-only docs tooling (`@redocly/*`) requires Node >= 20.19 or 22.12. If your Node is slightly older (e.g., 20.18.x), you may see harmless `npm WARN EBADENGINE` during install. Either:

- Upgrade Node to 20.19+ (recommended), or
- Ignore the warnings if you aren’t generating docs.

To generate/update API docs later:

```bash
npm run api:docs   # builds docs/api.html from docs/openapi.yaml
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Gaming Job Board Setup

- Configure Gemini: In-app go to Settings and paste your Google AI Studio API key (uses gemini-2.5-flash by default).
- Enable studio job sources: Edit `src/services/providers/companyBoards.ts` to add or tweak ATS board tokens (Greenhouse/Lever). A few popular studios are prefilled.
- Run locally:
  - Web: `npm run dev` (open Job Board view)
  - Desktop: `npm run electron-dev`
- Search and AI match: Use the Job Board to search; click "AI Job Matching" to rank jobs to your profile using Gemini.

### Notes

- The job aggregator includes source-available (noncommercial) plus per-studio ATS providers (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.). If a studio returns empty results, verify the token by visiting its public board URL (see comments in `companyBoards.ts`).
- You can extend providers or change priorities via the pluggable registry in `src/services/RefactoredJobAPIService.ts`.

### Update (Jobs Platform Consolidation)

- Canonical job route is `/jobs`. Any `/gaming-jobs` links now point to the same unified implementation.
- Canonical job service is `src/services/CanonicalJobService.ts` (re-exports the provider-based service).
- Page pointers are de-duplicated; all job board references resolve to the unified JobSearch view.
- Theme aligns to a black/white glass design with RGB neon accents for hover/focus.

## 📈 Recent Updates

- Install: Clarified Node requirement (>= 20.19 or 22.12+) to satisfy docs tooling (`@redocly/*`). Older 20.x may see harmless `EBADENGINE` warnings.
- macOS: Added a quick fix for `electron-builder` permission denied (code 126) during `npm install` — remove quarantine + set exec bits, or skip postinstall via `NAVI_SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1`.
- Docs: Linked `npm run api:docs` for generating `docs/api.html` when Redocly is available.

If you run into anything weird, ping issues — we’ll squish it.
