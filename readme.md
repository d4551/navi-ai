## Gaming Job Board Setup- Configure Gemini: In-app go to Settings and paste your Google AI Studio API key (uses gemini-2.5-flash by default).- Enable studio job sources: Edit src/services/providers/companyBoards.ts to add or tweak ATS board tokens (Greenhouse/Lever). A few popular studios are prefilled.- Run locally:  - 
pm install  - Web: 
pm run dev (open Job Board view)  - Desktop: 
pm run electron-dev- Search and AI match: Use the Job Board to search; click ‚ÄúAI Job Matching‚Äù to rank jobs to your profile using Gemini.Notes- The job aggregator includes source-available (noncommercial)s plus per-studio ATS providers (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.). If a studio returns empty results, verify the token by visiting its public board URL (see comments in companyBoards.ts).- You can extend providers or change priorities via the pluggable registry in src/services/RefactoredJobAPIService.ts.Update (Jobs Platform Consolidation)- Canonical job route is /jobs. Any /gaming-jobs links now point to the same unified implementation.- Canonical job service is src/services/CanonicalJobService.ts (re-exports the provider-based service).- Page pointers are de-duplicated; all job board references resolve to the unified JobSearch view.- Theme aligns to a black/white glass design with RGB neon accents for hover/focus.

## Install & RunPrerequisites- Node.js >= 18 (20 LTS recommended)- npm 9+ (bundled with Node installs) - For native modules on Windows (better-sqlite3, keytar):   - Python 3 (added to PATH)   - Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ Desktop workload)Quick Start (Desktop/Electron)- Clone and install: 
pm install- Dev mode (starts Vite + Electron): 
pm run electron-dev- Production preview (local build): 
pm run build && npm run electron- Package installers (Win/Mac/Linux): 
pm run electron-buildQuick Start (Web Only)- Dev server: 
pm run dev then open the shown URL- Preview a production build: 
pm run build && npm run preview
otes- To use a custom dev port for Electron: VITE_PORT=5180 npm run electron-dev:port- App settings persist locally; API keys are stored on your device and never committed.- First run may take a minute while dependencies build native modules.Troubleshooting- If Electron can‚Äôt find the dev server, ensure Vite is running on the same port or use electron-dev which starts both.- Clear caches on odd rebuild issues: 
pm run clean (or clean:all to remove 
ode_modules).- Windows PowerShell users may prefer electron-dev over electron-dev:port due to shell env syntax differences. - Rebuild native modules for Electron if launch fails: 
pm run rebuild:native
