# Screenshots Directory

This directory is prepared for application screenshots referenced in the README.md file.

## Current Status
Screenshots cannot be captured due to network restrictions preventing Chrome/Puppeteer installation in the build environment. The domain `googlechromelabs.github.io` is blocked, which prevents the automated screenshot tooling from being installed.

## Required Screenshots (when network allows)
- enhanced-gaming-dashboard.png - Gaming career dashboard with real-time job matching
- ai-interview-preparation.png - AI interview preparation interface with mock features
- ai-modal-system.png - AI assistance modal with context-aware suggestions
- ai-resume-builder.png - Resume builder with live AI feedback
- enhanced-job-board.png - Enhanced job board with gaming-specific filters

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Manual Screenshots**: Screenshots can be captured manually from the running application once it's installed in an environment with full network access.
2. **Network Allowlist**: The domain `googlechromelabs.github.io` could be added to the repository's allowlist to enable automated screenshot tooling.

These screenshots should showcase the current functional features of the NAVI AI application.
